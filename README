This is a script for openerp.
(I'm very lazy and want to do everything with a only one line :D, or less it's possible)

First, you will need install: 

  Ubuntu/Debian:
  libpq-dev python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev

  Fedora:
  python-devel postgresql-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel

And you have to install and configure postgres and apache

  createuser --createdb --username postgres --no-createrole --pwprompt < user >

Then run
  sh installer.sh
